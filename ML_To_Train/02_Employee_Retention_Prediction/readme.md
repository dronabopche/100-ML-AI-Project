<img src="02_Employee_Retention_Prediction/resources/02_emp.png" width="600">

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **employee turnover** using a structured dataset sourced from **Kaggle**.  
The objective is to build a **baseline Logistic Regression model** and improve it using **regularization techniques (L1 & L2)**, followed by a comprehensive comparison of model performance.

The project emphasizes **model interpretability, evaluation rigor, and comparative analysis**, making it suitable for academic work, interviews, and portfolio presentation.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a baseline Logistic Regression model for employee turnover prediction  
- Improve model performance using **L1 (Lasso)** and **L2 (Ridge)** regularization  
- Evaluate models using multiple classification metrics  
- Compare models visually and statistically  
- Recommend the best-performing model based on results

## 📊 Dataset Information

- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Dataset Size:** 1,350 rows × 16 columns  
- **Target Variable:** `Employee_Turnover`  
  - `0` → No Turnover  
  - `1` → Turnover  
- **Features:** 15 numerical employee-related metrics representing corporate scenarios  

> Dataset file used: `employee_turnover.csv`

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to understand data quality and target distribution:

- Dataset shape and data types inspection  
- Missing value analysis (no missing values found)  
- Target variable distribution analysis:
  - Nearly balanced classes (~50% turnover / ~50% no turnover)  
- Visualizations:
  - Bar chart of target counts  
  - Pie chart of target percentages  

Balanced data ensures reliable evaluation of classification models.

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing

Key preprocessing steps include:

- Separating features and target variable  
- Standardizing features using **StandardScaler** (critical for regularization)  
- Stratified train-test split:
  - **50% Training**
  - **50% Testing**
  - Ensures class balance in both sets

## 🤖 Models Implemented

### 1. Baseline Logistic Regression
**Why Logistic Regression?**
- Interpretable coefficients  
- Efficient training and prediction  
- Probabilistic outputs  
- Strong baseline for binary classification

- Performs implicit feature selection  
- Helps reduce model complexity  

---

### 3. L2 Regularized Logistic Regression (Ridge)
- Penalizes large coefficients  
- Prevents any single feature from dominating  
- Improves generalization

## 📊 Performance Summary

| Model          | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | AUC-ROC | R² Score |
|----------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|----------|
| Baseline       | 85.78%   | 87.27%    | 83.63% | 85.41%   | 0.948   | 0.431    |
| L1 (Lasso)     | 85.93%   | 87.08%    | 84.23% | 85.63%   | 0.948   | 0.437    |
| L2 (Ridge)     | 85.78%   | 87.27%    | 83.63% | 85.41%   | 0.948   | 0.431    |

# ML_To_Train

A structured repository containing multiple Machine Learning projects with a consistent and reusable folder architecture.

Each project includes:

* Dataset(s)
* Trained model(s)
* Source code (API + preprocessing + output)
* Notebook / experimentation file

This repository is designed so every ML project follows the same structure, making it easy to maintain and reuse for future projects.

## 📂 Standard Structure Inside Every Project

Each project follows this exact structure:

```
Project_Name/
│
├── Dataset/
│   └── <dataset files>.csv
│
├── Models/
│   └── <trained model files>
│
├── SRC/
│   ├── Output/
│   │   └── index.html
│   │
│   ├── Processing/
│   │   └── preprocessing.py
│   │
│   └── App.py
│
└── <Project Notebook>.ipynb
```

## 📌 Folder Explanation

### Dataset/

* Contains raw datasets used in training.
* Naming rule: dataset file names should be clean and readable.
* No underscores required.
* Example:

  * SmartCartCustomer.csv
  * EmployeeRetention.csv

---

### Models/

* Contains trained model files.
* Examples:

  * .pkl
  * .joblib
  * .h5
  * saved pipelines

---

### SRC/

This folder contains the complete API pipeline.

#### SRC/App.py

* Entry point of the project.
* Runs the API.
* Handles:

  * request input
  * preprocessing call
  * model inference
  * response output

#### SRC/Processing/

* All preprocessing logic is stored here.
* Includes:

  * missing value handling
  * encoding
  * scaling
  * feature transformations

#### SRC/Output/

* Contains output UI (frontend).
* The output is usually shown in:

  * index.html
* Displays final results like:

  * risk score
  * prediction class
  * timestamp / confidence

---

## 📌 Naming Convention Rules

### Project Folder Naming

All project folder names follow:

* Title Case
* Words separated by underscore `_`

Example:

* Creditwise_Loan_Approval
* Smart_Car_Clustering_System
* Heart_Health_Risk_Predictor

---

### Dataset Naming

Dataset file names follow:

* Normal readable words
* Spaces allowed
* No underscores required

Example:

* SmartCartCustomer.csv
* LoanApproval.csv

---

### Notebook Naming

Notebook name matches the project name in readable format.

Example:

* Smart_Car_Clustering System.ipynb
* Creditwise_Loan_Approval.ipynb

---

## 📌 API Flow (Standard for All Projects)

Every project API works like this:

1. Input JSON comes into App.py
2. Data goes to SRC/Processing/
3. Missing values are handled (filled with constants or rules)
4. Data is passed to the model from Models/
5. Model returns prediction / score
6. Output is returned:

   * as JSON response
   * and/or displayed in SRC/Output/index.html

---

## Running Any Project

Go into the project folder and run:

```bash
cd Project_Name/SRC
python App.py
```
